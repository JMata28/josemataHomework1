	In case the professor doesn't let me use strings.Fields:
	There are two separators that I want to use: a space and a new line, so that every word (each substring) is its own element in the slice.
	To achieve this spliting with two separators, I used the "iterative splitting" method, which is based on the code found in this website:
	https://marketsplash.com/tutorials/go/golang-split-string/

	delimiters := []string{" ", "\n"} //I'm creating a slice that contains the delimiters that I want to use to split the string
	for _, delimiter := range delimiters { //For each delimiter in the delimiters slice
		segments := strings.Split(str, delimiter)   //In the segments slice, include the substring separated by the delimiter
		str = strings.Join(segments, " ")
	}
	for i := 0; i <len(Allwords);
